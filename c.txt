LINE:  Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with "probabilities". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say "well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.

You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, "A", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed "B". (BTW, B is tech intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.

LINE:  Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized. However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term. There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil. One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc. And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc. Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.

LINE:  The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in? Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue. The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains. Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working. Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains. Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.

But what is this?! has the community not gotten smaller? was it not caused by the automobile? have I not sourced the statement as asked? is it not a fact? is it not information? does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not? if so it should be noted that I simply re-added the information after it was removed. was not the removal frivilous and unwarranted? what is the problem? why insist on the absence of this statement? it is unjustifiable. it is negligible. I am re adding the information as it is: A)factual, B) sourced, and C) informative.

CORRECTED:  wow .
i understand that the sentence I " added " was not crucial and really does not change the content .
But what is this ? !
has the community not gotten smaller ?
was it not caused by the automobile ?
have I not source the statement as asked ?
is it not a fact ?
is it not information ?
does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was ?
is it not the only peace of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present ?
is the usfullness of the exit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not ?
if so it should be noted that I simply re - added the information after it was removed .
was not the removal frivolous and unwarranted ?
what is the problem ?
why insist on the absence of this statement ?
it is unjustifiable .
it is negligible .

LINE:  The organization of sub-topics. Culture is thrown way down towards the end, after economy and tourism, which is inappropriate. The information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography, which makes it not only uninteresting, but also repetitive. Information is interspersed all through the sub-sections, without regard to whether or not they fit there. Eg, the Geography section starts with the fact that UP is the 5th largest state. That is not strictly geography, and belongs in the introduction. Climate belongs towards the latter part of the page, perhaps before toursim. Regions and cities is not such an interesting combination. In any case, "Cities of Uttar Pradesh" can be an interesting topic on its own, because, UP has several interesting cities (and regions) each with specialities of its own (like the copperware of Moradabad, ceramics of Khurja and carpets of Bhadohi). In fact I remember there used to be such information in the article before.( )

LINE:  You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified, that's really not my concern here, since it's a dead letter. I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal. If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time. Look at Issei Sagawa. Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time. That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right. I don't think it's going out on a limb to say that the Sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief.

I am old enough to have been around in 1956 (though I was a small boy) and I can tell you that we and our neighbors in Southern California had lighted, outdoor trees prior to 1956, and no one thought it remarkable or unusual.

LINE:  Thanks. From my point of view there are differences and parallels between the two concepts: One parallel is that both concepts are intending a territory with a homogeneous population. The difference is: the concept of racial hygiene is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium "race" (whatever "race" might be), the concept of ethnically homogeneous states is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium "ethnicity". A second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history (example: the holocaust - not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process).

LINE:  Has anyone ever considered including tag-team edit warring as a 3RR violation? When two people act in tandem (unintentionally or intentionally) to make the same revert four times, they may not technically violate the 3RR rule, but they certainly do so in spirit. This was the problem on both sides in the edit war on the Canada page, and precisely what I wanted to avoid on the Dominion page. Would it not be easier to warn editors as you did here rather than shut down pages for weeks at a time as was done in the Canada case? I'm sure this would cure the escalation problem without blocking access to pages. Any comments on this?

Second, the only reference/link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that. It appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link. It's possible that some came from this as well, I can't tell. I'll also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic, so the article is riddled with grammatical errors, mostly incomplete sentences. On creation, the opening read "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 2055) is a bill passed to the 112th United States Congress" I've never heard this usage (to rather than by) and assume it is incorrect, another editor changed it, the lead is also missing an important determiner. In any case, you can take a look at  Vesey

CORRECTED:  All of those statements need to be reference .
Leaving an article unreverenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for actually inaccurate information .

Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.

LINE:  Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech.

LINE:  Just to clarify, I've opened a new section to indeed alert some contributors that they were behaving in a way in line with the examples of ownership behaviour as described here. In return the title of the section has been twisted to something unrelated and one of my message has been erased. It is the first time I see people editing other's signed contributions in a talk page. This just looks crazy to me.

LINE:  Noel, you are an expert. Please convince Whig history fans (or the lazy minds) about how Bonnie Prince Charlie did not want to dissolve the Union, that the United Kingdom began with the Stuarts as opposed to the Hanoverians. Tell them how the Whigs rewrote history to blame everything on the Stuarts, whom are credited as ultimate failures with no positive contributions to the foundations of Great Britain in their Stewart and Tudor blood. The Sovereign's will is the Realm, or else it is not a kingdom. The British might as well be living in a republic, at least if the Parliamentarians had their way. Even the Hanoverian heirs recognise that the Stuarts founded the UK. Please debate that here & thanks.

LINE:  Looked into it, and this editor seems to be pushing an anti-LGBT agenda. They've done similar stuff over at Sailor Moon, and made "official-looking" warnings to other editors.

I don't personally watch/read Sailor Moon or know much about it, so I'm not confident enough to re-add the categories, but the reasoning for their removal is flawed regardless, and there is a sourced part in the article about female homosexuality.talk

LINE:  The spelling "Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric "...today's the last I'll be spreading" rather than "spending". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical.

LINE:  The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as "Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.

The picture is useful for another reason, as it shows a similar relative position of the LEM and the antenna for this Apollo 14 flight as on that web page that argues about those objects in Apollo 12. In both cases, the antenna is at a 45 degree angle away from the LEM, and both the near photo and the distant photo on that website are consistent with each other, despite the website's claims to the contrary.

LINE:  DECT isn't really a new technology. It's a newer standard, but TDM/TDMA/FDMA digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of DECT. DECT is itself a successor to CT2, Japan's PHS is very similar, and, of course, GSM, D-AMPS, and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. To suggest there are special health issues with DECT would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. DECT is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces, both during transmissions, and inherently because even when in use the TD nature of the system means the system isn't transmitting continuously.

Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better. Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians. As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad. Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed).

LINE:  No, I didn't mean point me at a biographical article (though that would be good too). I mean answer right here on the discussion page: What town were you born in? Which schools did you go to?

As for "greatest living magicians", I have to admit I'd never heard those names. How are you judging that, say, Max Maven is better than a David Copperfield? Is it by awards, industry press, or just personal opinion of their technique?

It needs a fresh, uninvolved eye, though I think the most volatile of the concerns with one of the hooks has been addressed. Please let me know. (Laura Hale has already declined, and as I've promised to obtain that independent review, I need to find someone to do it.) Thank you.

LINE:  Sorry, I consulted you before I did anything else. Then I noticed you'd posted to the second debate, so I left a note there. No, I'm afraid the closing reason is not beside the point. I am going to reverse you, but do feel free to re-close it as a "no consensus" if you wish. Closing on a technicality, when some people are arguing for deletion is simply going to frustrate people and lead to a needless second debate on DRV and AfD. You do not close a debate on the ground of the nominators wishes, unless no one else is suggesting delete.

LINE:  How should the overlap with the Martins Bank article be treated? The name change to Martins is really a red herring - it is the Liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by Barclays and therefore I suggest should be the main article.

LINE:  Legally, there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the Schengen area (there are such criteria for joining the EU, but this is a different matter). The only possibility to join the Schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the EU, which includes a clause that Schengen-related EU law would be applicable in the associated non-EU state. The associated state would only have the right to be consulted. Thus, the U.S. would have to accept each and every majority (!) decision taken in Brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. And the U.S. would have to accept that every third-country national holding a residence title of a Schengen state could enter the U.S. without even being checked. To BIL: Guadeloupe and French Guiana are not inside the Schengen area because this would e.g. require France to equip the complete rain forest border between French Guiana and Suriname, Brasil etc. with high-tech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border - just in order to avoid ID checks on flights between there and Europe. I can understand why they do not invest any money into this.

LINE:  Not tactics. You create a page about a non-existant subsiduary, change all the links and then complain when things don't go your way. You created the chaos and then demand that others fix the problem that YOU created. You stuffed it - YOU fix it. Pretty simple in my book. Things were pretty good until you invented the BMW Motorrad subsiduary and changed everything. Now that it has been shown that you were wrong you blame everyone else for the chaos caused by your arrogance. Maybe returning things to how they were before you broke it would be a good idea. Oh! An apology would also be good!

The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means.

In that comment you also said "I'd really like to avoid protecting them for the duration if that can be avoided, but if you keep bringing issues to my attention, I'll do my utmost to make your life easier".

So. How can my life be made easier? SPI? I already filed one, on one sock master (though that's probably a different person) and some other users have filed others (for example ). The problem is - and notice that a CU has not even gotten around to the SPI I filed - that by the time the CUs get around to considering these cases, the person(s) behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved onto new SPAs which keep doing the same thing. Not sure what the best course of action here is but it's helluva frustrating trying to deal with this.

I already filed one , on one sick master ( though that is probably a different person ) and some other users have filed others ( for example ) .
The problem is - and notice that a CU has not even gotten around to the SPI I filed - that by the time the CUs get around to considering these cases , the persons ) behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved on new SPAs which keep doing the same thing .
Not sure what the best course of action here is
but it is helluva frustrating trying to deal with this . 

ISPELL:  Hi HA. In the message you left on my talk page (here), you explained your reasoning for not protecting the relevant articles. As my response there indicates I don't share your opinion, but I understand where you're coming from. In that comment you also said "I'd really like to avoid protecting them for the duration if that can be avoided, but if you keep bringing issues to my attention, I'll do my utmost to make your life easier". So this is the "bring the issues to your attention" on my part. See this 3ERR request filed by . It's sort of gone past "lots of disruptive anon Dips" causing trouble on these pages, to pretty much full blown sock puppetry and abuse of multiple accounts by at least - though likely, more - one person. So. How can my life be made easier? SPIC? I already filed one, on one sock master (though that's probably a different person) and some other users have filed others (for example ). The problem is - and notice that a ICU has not even gotten around to the SPIC I filed - that by the time the CPUs get around to considering these cases, the person(s) behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved onto new Spams which keep doing the same thing. Not sure what the best course of action here is but it's helluva frustrating trying to deal with this.

LINE:  I understood it to be a term of art, not a literal enunciation of a belief that a disembodied deity had possessed the bodies of humans in eastern Virginia at the polling booth. Such a notion would be inconsistent with Brat's free will theology and none of the RS that includes this quote have indicated he meant it as anything more than a literary flourish. If they were unambiguous he intended to communicate he was in contact with God or some other super-being then we'd have something. But they didn't. Right now we're making a scrapbook, rather than an encyclopedia article.

LINE:  I think the formula is correct as it stands. You can check it out on some test data eg: loan of 1 million for 20 years @ 10% monthly. Formula gives half life as 14.34 years: near as d.. to 172 months and using Excel's PV function for the remainder (68 months) we are a tad short of half way at 499401.52. With the minus sign in we get -5.66 years - oh dear! Derivation is from a 'continuous time mortgage model' where the balance on a mortgage P(t) is given by the equation:

LINE:  It doesn't matter if they call them "English" in the scources you provided, the British are commonly called "English" but the term is incorrect because after 1707 it was the Kingdom of Great Britain. If this were a WWI article and you replaced German with Prussian that would be about the same thing you are doing now. Not all scources are correct and it is unencyclopedic to call the British "English" as there are also Scots, Welsh, Cornish, and Irish people in Great Britian and calling them all "English" is not correct and "English" needs to be changed to British. If hope a British user backs me up on this because what I am saying is 100% right and the vandalism warning I gave you is justified so please do not call it a personal attack as it is not.

LINE:  Pretty much what I said the first day this was posted. Now, I have neither a problem with the Cabal's decision nor in the Cabal's logic (as Deamon138 does). My concern is why a vote that basically said "I don't know" means it stays at Burma. By the Cabal's conclusion...If the article had happened to be frozen at Myanmar before the mediation, and we had the same Cabal, it would now be a Myanmar article. I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination. Choice 4 just doesn't look that appealing.

When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre blot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination. Choice 4 just doesn't look that appealing.

LINE:  Phylogenies (i.e., dictomously branching processes) are processes that involve things, that is, objects, and as such have to be modeled by Object-Oriented Modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.

LINE:  I see that you are deleting my corrections regarding the General American accent, in the article "Midwest," which quite wrongly implies that General American is owned lock stock and barrel by that region. It's nonsense. The General American accent is spoken all over the north, from Seattle to Connecticut. You are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the Midwest, before I'kk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight. It certainly is not unique to the Midwest, a region which was not even settled by English speakers until barely 150 years ago, after the northern accent was known to exist in places like Pennsylvania and upstate NY, and Connecticut. It really bugs me to see the Midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the Northeast. The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same. And we've been speaking this way since before the Midwest was even settled, so it's nonsense to say it's a Midwest accent.

The General American accent is spoken all over the north , from Seattle to Connecticut .
You are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the Midwest , before I'kk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight .
It certainly is not unique to the Midwest , a region which was not even settled by English speakers until barely 150 years ago , after the northern accent was known to exist in places like Pennsylvania and upstate NY , and Connecticut .
It really but me to see the Midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the Northeast .
The original author blunders badly by jumping the accents of certain turban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas .
Anybody from my region , the Syracuse , NY area , formerly Albany , NY , knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest .
I challenge anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side - by - side with upstate New Yorkers , and tell which is which .
It is impossible , it is the same accent , utterly and completely the same .
And we have been speaking this way since before the Midwest was even settled
, so it is nonsense to say it is a Midwest accent .

LINE:  Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.

LINE:  The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).

First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding.

In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.

LINE:  As far as I know there were no warrants of arrest for Thomas Jefferson from the British Crown. There is nothing in the writings of Thomas Jefferson that states he was committing treason and could be hung. Jefferson, Washingtion, and Adams, according to Ferling (2000) believed they were slaves to the British government, not having any rights. They did not view themselves as outlaw rebels, rather, they wanted to be free to make their own laws that protected white people. Franklin apparently is the only Founding Father who mentioned being hung. Was Jefferson in the room at the time Franklin made this statement?

LINE:  Did you even look at my edit before reverting it? I did change it up as you wanted to say that Rex thinks it doesnt work. and as you said, it hits on many things that are also said elsewhere in the article, making it perfect for the lead. Just because it is stated elsewhere in the article by other sources doesn't mean we can also use this source. The more sources the better. I would suggest we both stop touching the article until you come up with a clear reason why it shouldn't be added. As I know all too well how this works, no one touches it in order to finish this dispute, and then the person who didn't want the information in the article will just stop discussing because they think they have won. and then revert whenever the page gets changed.
